I implemented admin features for managing consumer details and billing, along with consumer-side functionalities such as multi-consumer registration, bill viewing, payment tracking, and complaint management.  I was recognized as one of the top six performers based on my performance in exams and case studies throughout the training.",

    desc: "During my internship at Solomons International Technologies, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that significantly enhanced my skills in NLP (NLP) and full-stack development. One of the projects involved developing a system for document classification, specifically for resumes, where I implemented algorithms to accurately categorize resumes into different classifications such as software developer or other custom categories provided by the user. Additionally, I worked on a named entity recognition (NER) project, where I developed algorithms to extract specific entities from text, such as names, organizations, and locations. Another project I undertook was topic modeling, where I created a system to generate relevant topics from text using machine learning algorithms. Lastly, I worked on a document matching project, where I developed an algorithm to match job orders with resumes and generate a score based on the relevance of the match. These projects not only improved my technical skills but also provided me with valuable insights into the practical applications of NLP. I am grateful for the experience and look forward to applying these skills in future projects.",
